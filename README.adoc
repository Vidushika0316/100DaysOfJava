# 100DaysOfJava
Every day for a hundred days, I posted brief Java material to my social media channels. Here, I used Java to test problems in LeetCode and attempted to find the best algorithm with the least amount of space and time complexity. Use short code snippets to learn.

100 Days of Java was an initiative that consisted of 100 uninterrupted days sharing content about Java on my social media.

If you have any questions, ask me on my **[social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vidushika-dasanayaka/)**

public class Day001 {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {

        int[] ans=new int[2];
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++){

                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
                    ans[0]=i;
                    ans[1]=j;
                    break;

                }
            }
        }
        return ans;

    }
